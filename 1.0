1.0 Initial research
Introduction

The initial research methodology recommends various steps you can take in order to learn more about the organization you are evaluating. Sometimes referred to as “preliminary reconnaissance” or “open source information gathering,” this stage of the assessment:

    does not require privileged access to the organization’s offices, infrastructure or staff (though access to certain third-party commercial databases or research services might occasionally come in handy);

    relies primarily on third-party data sources, rather than direct observation and testing of the organization’s infrastructure;

    can generally be carried out from any secure Internet connection;

    is largely concerned with gathering information that you will use in later stages of the assessment; and

    does not focus on identifying of vulnerabilities; but

    may nonetheless expose certain threats, particularly with regard to publicly-accessible information that is presumed to be confidential, such as the identity of sensitive staff, the existence of sensitive partner- and funder-relationships, or the organization’s history of participation in sensitive events or travel to sensitive locations.
