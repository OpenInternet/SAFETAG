1.1.2 MX Record Assessment
Priority

Info
Summary

MX, or Mail Exchange, records are required to be public for any domain you wish to receive email through. These records can still reveal sensitive information about your hosting set-up.

Description

MX Records can reveal vulnerable mail servers or information about other services hosted internally. The research phase records all the non-invasive information about the record and where it points, for later analysis in 2.1 / Email assessment.
MitigationTitle

No Specific Mitigation Needed
MitigationDescription

Unless the research or 2.1 reveals specific vulnerabilities, there is no action to take. Unless you have sufficient in-house expertise, it is often recommended to not host email servers. While self-hosted email provides more control and potentially security, managing the security of the server is a complex job. Other mail services, such as MailControl or Postini, also can provide some level of protection by being a first-pass check for spam and viruses, and (slightly) reducing the visibility of your organizational mail server.
