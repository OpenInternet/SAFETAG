2.2.2 Website CMS/software is out of date or custom
Priority

Medium
Summary

Content management systems require ongoing maintenance and updates to stay secure.
Description

For websites using a content management system (Drupal, Wordpress, Joomla or similar), it is important to use a popular and open source tool (as opposed to a custom tool that a web design firm has put together for its customer base). Open source tools are more likely to have their security holes discovered and fixed at a rapid pace, but the burden remains on the organization to keep up to date with these security updates.

The top CMS tools have dashboards and other tools to help alert the webmaster to available updates, and security updates should be heeded quickly. For sites that hold password data, it is worth exploring additional security features – the built-in password security for even modern CMS systems is weak, but the methods to improve upon them vary widely depending on the system.

For sites built on custom CMS software which does not regularly receive updates, it is strongly advisable to migrate to a more standard, open source system.

Note that “Static” websites – those created with a web design tool and uploaded to a server – are both more secure (no code to break) and also withstand denial of service attacks easier. However, these are more difficult to maintain and update, and work best only for “brochure” style sites.
MitigationTitle

Update CMS software, focusing first on security releases
MitigationDescription

Most popular CMS platforms provide emailed alerts and semi-automated ways to update their software. Make sure someone responsible for the website is either receiving these emails or checking regularly for available updates. Security updates should be applied immediately. It is a best practice however to have a “test” site where you can first deploy any CMS update before attempting it on a production site.

For custom CMS systems, it is strongly advisable to migrate to a more standard, open source system.

2.2.2 [sample evidence] Website CMS/Software is out of date
Summary

The CMS running at http://www.sampleorg.org is out of date and opens up potential security vulnerabilities.
Description

The publicly-accessible CHANGELOG file at http://www.sampleorg.org/CHANGELOG.txt reveals an out of date, and security-compromised (https://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2012-004), version of Drupal. Upgrade immediately.

Drupal 6.27, 2012-12-19
----------------------
- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities), see SA-CORE-2012-004.
Drupal 6.26, 2012-05-02
----------------------
- Fixed a small number of bugs.
- Made code documentation improvements.

For Drupal, try visiting /CHANGELOG.txt , which, if not manually removed, will reveal the most recent version of Drupal installed on the server. Other telltale signs depend on the specific Drupal release; http://corporate.adulmec.ro/blog/2010/drupal-detection-test-site-running-drupal maintains a detection tool.

For Joomla, default templates provide strong hints towards versions based on copyright dates. Specific versions can often be discovered using this guide: https://www.gavick.com/magazine/how-to-check-the-version-of-joomla.html

Wordpress sites tend to advertise their version number in the header of each webpage, such as

<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 3.3.1" />

There is a web-based tool with browser add-ons available here: http://www.whitefirdesign.com/tools/wordpress-version-check.html
