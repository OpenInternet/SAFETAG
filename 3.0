3.0 Perimeter assessment
Introduction

In a sense, the Perimeter assessment methodology focuses on evaluating security controls that prevent the previous (remote assessment) module and the subsequent (local assessment) module from meaning the same thing. This includes technologies such as firewalls, wireless access-points, and internal virtual private networking (VPN) servers, among others. Anything that prevents an attacker on the Internet, or sitting in a car parked outside, from gaining access to the office LAN or to some other in-scope network from which staff do their work. Technically, it also includes things like door and window locks (although, for most organizations, if an attacker can waltz into the office at night, the fact that he or she might then plug something into an exposed Ethernet port is probably the least of their worries).

As usual, there is some ambiguity to the scope of this module. If you send an HTML email message containing an embedded “tracking image” to a staff member—in order to determine, for example, the external IP address of the main office—you might consider that to be a perimeter attack. After all, you are inducing a particular action (a request for a particular Web resource) from within the office LAN, while you yourself are outside that network. From a technical perspective, this would be a reasonable place to document such a test, but you might find that others intuitively expect something like that to show up in your research or remote assessment write-up. By contrast, a vulnerable “intranet” that allows an attacker to scan other internal Web applications from the privacy of his or her own home might fit the bill nicely.

This is addressed in more detail below, under the local assessment methodology, but one of the most important roles of a network perimeter has to do with preventing active and passive sniffing attacks. Organizations should be concerned about the ability of an attacker to flop down at an Internet cafe or hotel (or apartment building), where one or more its staff members are working, and pull out a laptop. And occasionally you will even find an organization willing to take threats like this seriously. But the point at which all organizations start to pay attention is when you present a credible scenario in which that same attacker is able to sniff the entire organization’s unencrypted traffic whenever he or she feels like it.
