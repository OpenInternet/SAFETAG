4.0 Local assessment
Introduction

The local assessment methodology serves two main purposes. First, for organizations with weak perimeter controls, it often represents the only remaining line of defense between an attacker and whatever sensitive data are stored or transmitted internally. A surprisingly common response from IT administrators, when confronted with a significant local vulnerability, is something like, “Sure but that’s all inside the firewall, right?” Often, this statement is technically correct—that is, after all, the point of a firewall—but one hears this even from staff who are well aware that their wireless password is the name of the organization. (And, of course, if you present them with this vulnerability first, you might hear: “Sure, but that’s just access to the network…all of the sensitive local stuff is protected, right?” In other words, there is often some degree of magical thinking around the sanctity of the LAN.

It is worth mentioning that a variation of this dynamic applies even to organizations that do not host any services, or store any data, within the local network. It is not uncommon for a cash-strapped human rights NGO to outsource most of its IT infrastructure to a cloud provider, such as Google Apps, or to whatever jumble of ad hoc services (Dropbox, Yahoo! mail, Wordpress, Basecamp, etc.) that its staff might already have been using. On the other end of the spectrum, a better-resourced organization is more likely to host its critical services at a remote data center somewhere. In either of these situations, your local assessment will focus primarily on the security of individual users’ devices and their network traffic. Perimeter defenses protect staff workstations and smartphones, sure, but they also represent the only obstacle between an attacker and a point-of-presence on an organization’s LAN that would allow him or her to sniff the organization’s unencrypted traffic.

Secondly, your local assessment provides an opportunity to advocate for the principle of “defense in depth.” Even where perimeter defenses are strong, organizations that rely too heavily on that single point-of-failure should be encouraged to consider the brittleness of their digital security: a single compromised staff machine, router vulnerability, or misconfigured firewall, and this is what could happen…
