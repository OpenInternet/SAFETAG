5.1.2 Insecure storage of sensitive data, particularly on laptops of traveling staff
Priority

High
Summary

An attacker who obtains a staff laptop will be able to read, record or modify any sensitive information on the device, even if that staff member has set a strong Windows password. This applies to threats involving loss, theft and confiscation, but also to “checkpoint” scenarios in which the attacker may only have access for a few minutes. Furthermore, in the event of a burglary or office raid, an attacker could easily obtain all sensitive information on the organization’s laptops within a few hours. And, if she were able to enter and leave the building without being noticed, SampleOrg might not even realize that its data had been compromised.

Hard disk encryption
MitigationDescription

All staff computers, but especially the laptops used by those who travel to and from remote work sites, should be configured to use Microsoft BitLocker or Truecrypt encryption. The former is free-of-charge for anyone with a valid Windows 7 “Ultimate” license, and the latter is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). For Apple OSX users, FileVault is a built-in alternative that is also free-of-charge. All three solutions provide a way to encrypt data on USB memory sticks, as well, which is essential if such devices are being used to transport sensitive, work-related data.
