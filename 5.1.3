5.1.3 Data on office workstations and servers are unencrypted
Priority

High
Summary

In the event of a burglary or office raid, an attacker could easily obtain all sensitive information on the organization’s desktop and server machines, even if they are configured with strong login passwords. If the attacker is able to enter and leave the building without being noticed, you may not be aware that this attack—which can be carried out in a few hours—has taken place.
Description

While few tools provide great safety against a physical break-in, there are ways to make it more challenging for an adversary to gather critical data.
MitigationTitle

Enable hard drive encryption
MitigationDescription

In addition to critical data being stored in a more secure part of the office, and protected with strong passwords (with automatic time-outs to lock-screens configured), encrypting the hard drives means that if a server is powered down for transport, recovering data from its hard drives will be almost impossible.

Servers, external hard drives, and backup systems should be configured to use some form of hard drive encryption. For Windows, Microsoft BitLocker is built in to the latest versions, free-of-charge for anyone with a valid Windows 7 “Ultimate” license or Windows 8. For Apple OSX users, FileVault2 is a built-in alternative that is also free-of-charge. TrueCrypt is a cross-platform solution that is open source and free of charge, and can work on Mac, Windows, and Linux machines as well. All three solutions provide a way to encrypt data on internal drives as well as external hard drives, and USB memory sticks.
