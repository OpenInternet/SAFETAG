6.0 Staff assessment
Introduction

A common refrain, among auditors, software developers and other specialists in this sector, is that digital security is not about technology; it is about people. This is undeniably true, and even the previous SAFETAG modules—despite their more direct fixation on technology—acknowledge this insight by emphasizing the educational and a persuasive roles played by your findings report. The staff assessment methodology focuses more directly on the human behavior aspect of digital security. For the time being, it is primarily a list of questions to help you “interview” staff members who play various roles in the organization, but it also provides a home for future expansion of the framework into higher level realms of digital security. Likely examples include:

    teachable adversary- and threat-modeling methodologies,
    organizational policies and best-practices,
    tips and tricks to encourage (and evaluate) positive behavior change within the organization

Some of the responses you receive to these questions might belong in the final report itself (either transcribed or paraphrased), and the SAFETAG reporting template provides a structure for this. However, they will also help you identify elements of an organization’s infrastructure and workflow that you might otherwise have overlooked. Furthermore, staff interviews often lead the way to a deeper exploration of potential technical vulnerabilities. Accordingly, you probably do not want to save this phase of the assessment for your last day on-site.

Q&A sessions are unabashedly white box aspects of a security assessment, and you will occasionally hear push-back along the lines of, “sure, but you wouldn’t even have found that thing if we hadn’t told you about this other thing.” Compelling black box findings certainly do have an advantage when it comes to persuasiveness, but obtaining them can be quite time-consuming, so relying exclusively on vulnerabilities that you can identify without “help” is generally a mistake in this resource-constrained sector.

And remember, whatever play-by-play threat scenarios you present in your report need not rise to the level of “journalism.” They are more like allegories. So, if you are given a “tip,” or some level of privileged access, that leads you to a vulnerability, you can often work backward from there to create a credible scenario in which some attacker (perhaps one with more time or expertise than you yourself have) arrives at the same destination, but without “cheating.” This is not only legitimate, it is an excellent technique.
