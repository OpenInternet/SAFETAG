### Part I: Process Identification

The goal of this activity is to give the trainee's an opportunity to lead an opportunity to lead a process mapping with the host organization.

#### Determine the boundaries

The goal of this exercise is to have the trainee lead a conversation about the boundaries of the needs assessment. This exercises acts as an introduction between the auditor and the host participants and is used to build a rapport with the participants. This also allows the auditor to set the organizational focus for the rest of the needs assessment and work towards a realistic scope of the threats that participants should be thinking about during the assessment.

  * step 1
  * step 2
  * step 3
  * step etc.

#### List all organizational process'

The goal of this exercise is for the trainee to lead the host participants in "brain-storming" a list of all the processes that are critical for their work.

  * step 1
  * step 2
  * step 3
  * step etc.

#### Identify critical process'

In this exercises the trainee does free-hand mapping for each process guided by the host participants. The trainee needs to make sure that they work to develop a broad understanding of the overall process. This is a time consuming activity, and managing their overall time to complete the entire needs assessment, and respect the time constraints of the staff, is critical.

  * "We will be charting the sequence of events of this process. We want to represent the process, as it actually happens - NOT what you might prefer it to be!"
  * step 2
  * step 3
  * step etc.

### Part II: Critical Process Mapping

The goal of this exercise is for the trainee to lead the attendees in identifying the subset of activities that are critical to their work. Helping the organization triage these processes is at the core of how an auditor continues their assessment. An auditor uses this subset to guide their audit. If an auditor is not mindful of making sure that there are processes among the critical processes identified that speak to the full range of participants their recommendations are more likely to meet resistance.

#### Map out critical process'

In this exercises the trainee does free-hand mapping for each process guided by the host participants. The trainee needs to make sure that they work to develop a broad understanding of the overall process. This is a time consuming activity, and managing their overall time to complete the entire needs assessment, and respect the time constraints of the staff, is critical.

  * "We will be charting the sequence of events of this process. We want to represent the process, as it actually happens - NOT what you might prefer it to be!"
  * step 2
  * step 3
  * step etc.
  * Identify any processes that this critical process relies on and work with group to decide if it should be added to the list of critical process' to map out.

### Part III: Risk Modeling

#### Explaining the types of risks

This short exercise is not as interactive for the host organizations participants as many in this section, and as such can be more difficult for a trainee who is less comfortable lecturing to groups.

  * step 1
  * step 2
  * step 3
  * step etc.
  * Identify Current Approaches to addressing risks
    * Identify the warning's, notices, status indicators, training, and policies that already exist to address these risks.
	* *NOTE:* We do this so that we can anchor proposed action in existing practices in the report. - (Shostack: Threat Modeling pg. 298)

#### The Pre-Mortum

The trainer has the participants imagine that it is months in the future and the process has been carried out. And it has failed. The participants have to explain why it failed.

*NOTE:* The participants can optionally be split into groups for this process. The trainer should do one process with the group as a whole before the participants are split into groups. If split into groups, each group will need a note-taker so that the trainer can walk between the groups and assist them if they get stuck.

  * step 1
  * step 2
  * step 3
  * step etc.

#### Identifying the consequence of risks on identified process/action

This exercise has the trainee lead the participants on a brainstorming of hypothetical consequences when certain risks occur to the process' and actions identified earlier.

*NOTE {.note}* It can be easy for a group to get distracted arguing over the likelihood of certain risks over others. The trainer may need to assist the trainee in re-focusing the group. If this happens, the trainer should make a note of it and go over techniques for managing these kinds of brainstorms with a large group.

  * step 1
  * step 2
  * step 3
  * step etc.

#### Ranking consequences from harmless to severe

The goal of this exercise is to have the trainee lead the host organization in classifying the severity of the possible consequences from the risks they have just explored. 

  * step 1
  * step 2
  * step 3
  * step etc.

### Part IV: Asset Enumeration

#### Identify technology used

The goal of this exercise is for the trainee to guide the participants through a rapid identification of the technology used in the process' they outlined. This activity will identify the core services that the auditor will use to flesh out an asset map. 

*NOTE: {.note}* This activity is about an auditor identifying the technological scope of the organization. The auditor will have a chance to explore the actual infrastructure during the remainder of the audit. This activity should be fun and quick.

  * step 1
  * step 2
  * step 3
  * step etc.

### Part V: Post Needs Assessment

#### Documenting a Needs Assessment

The goal of this exercise is to have the trainees document the needs assessment that they just ran. This needs assessment documentation will be what the trainee's use for the remainder of the host hands-on audit training.

  * process and asset map
  * risk matrix
  * step 3
  * step etc.

#### Reevaluating the Assessment plan based activities

The goal of this exercise is for the trainees to have the opportunity to re-evaluate the initial assessment plan based upon the needs assessment. This will give them an opportunity to see how other trainees would start to tie audit priorities to the needs assessment. 

  * step 1
  * step 2
  * step 3
  * step etc.
