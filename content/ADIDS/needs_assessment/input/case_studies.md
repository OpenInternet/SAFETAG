### Process Mapping

*Introduction:* Pro solum postea cetero at, volutpat dissentiunt sed eu. Ad has illud repudiandae, nec labore alienum liberavisse ea, at per ponderum tincidunt deseruisse. Sonet mediocrem et sea, vix at inani falli disputationi. Eos efficiantur necessitatibus id. Consul instructior his an, vel dico epicurei ea, cu vis saepe dicant qualisque. Quod ancillae salutandi cu vim, feugait postulant eu nec.

#### A. Determine the boundaries

The goal of this exercise is to have the trainee lead a conversation about the boundaries of the needs assessment. This exercises acts as an introduction between the auditor and the host participants and is used to build a rapport with the participants. This also allows the auditor to set the organizational focus for the rest of the needs assessment and work towards a realistic scope of the threats that participants should be thinking about during the assessment.

### Determine Critical Process'

*Introduction:* With the process' that conmpose the core work of the organization identified, the next step is to identify the subset of activities that are critical to their work. The processes identified here will be what the auditor uses as a frame for the rest of their audit and reporting.

#### A. The Pre-Mortum

The Pre-Mortum is an exercise used to simplify the complex mapping tasks that the participants have just taken part in. With the process maps created the participants are to come up with the reasons that these process' could be disrupted and the consequences of those disruptions.

"[This] Excercise is to ask planner to imagine that it is months into the future and that their plan has been carried out. And it has failed. That is all they know; they have to explain why they think it has failed. they have to look for the causes that would make them say, "Of course, it wasn't going to work, because..." The idea is that they are breaking the emotional attachment to the plan's success by taking on the challenge of showing their creativity and competence by identifying likely sources of breakdown." - Klein

#### B. Determine critical process'

The goal of this exercise is for the trainee to lead the attendees in identifying the subset of activities that are critical to their work. Helping the organization triage these processes is at the core of how an auditor continues their assessment. An auditor uses this subset to guide their audit. If an auditor is not mindful of making sure that there are processes among the critical processes identified that speak to the full range of participants their recommendations are more likely to meet resistance.

#### C. Map out critical process'

In this exercises the trainee does free-hand mapping for each process guided by the host participants. The trainee needs to make sure that they work to develop a broad understanding of the overall process. This is a time consuming activity, and managing their overall time to complete the entire needs assessment, and respect the time constraints of the staff, is critical.

  * "We will be charting the sequence of events of this process. We want to represent the process, as it actually happens - NOT what you might prefer it to be!" 
  * step 2
  * step 3
  * step etc.
  *" Of the business processes listed in Step #1, which are the most critical to the continual operation of the business or agency? In determining criticality, consider the following:
    * Does this business function affect the safety of employees or the general public?
    * How important is this business function to the mission of the agency/business?
    * How important is this function to the continuity of business operations?
    * How would a loss or disruption affect the “bottom line?”

The following definitions may be used as a general guide and should be modified to meet the requirements of each specific process or function:
Critical – necessary and/or vital. May pose a life-safety risk to employees and/or general public.
Essential – important but not critical. Disruption would cause difficulties.
Non-Essential – disruption is merely inconvenient."

  * step etc.
  * Identify Current Approaches to addressing risks
    * Identify the warning's, notices, status indicators, training, and policies that already exist to address these risks.

#### B. Identifying the consequence of risks on identified process/action

This exercise has the trainee lead the participants on a brainstorming of hypothetical consequences when certain risks occur to the process' and actions identified earlier.

*NOTE {.note}* It can be easy for a group to get distracted arguing over the likelihood of certain risks over others. The trainer may need to assist the trainee in re-focusing the group. If this happens, the trainer should make a note of it and go over techniques for managing these kinds of brainstorms with a large group.

#### A. Identify technology used

The goal of this exercise is for the trainee to guide the participants through a rapid identification of the technology used in the process' they outlined. This activity will identify the core services that the auditor will use to flesh out an asset map. 

*NOTE: {.note}* This activity is about an auditor identifying the technological scope of the organization. The auditor will have a chance to explore the actual infrastructure during the remainder of the audit. This activity should be fun and quick.

  * Identify process' that are universal and process' that are individual. For individual process' the auditor will go around and work individually with staff to identify assets. The universal process' will be mapped out as a group in this process. 
  * Use failure points from post-mortum to identify the assets that are important to explore. 
  * step 3
  * step etc.
  * How to use Swim Lanes to explore "ceremonies"
