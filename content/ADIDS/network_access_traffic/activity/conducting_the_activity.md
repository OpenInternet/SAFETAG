#### Conducting the Activity

The trainer asks the participants to identify potentially unencrypted or unauthenticated network traffic (file shares, website logins).


While going through these scenarios, build a "generic" network map with the organization's laptops, mail server, router, wifi hotspot, and cloud services. Identify potentially unencrypted or unauthenticated network traffic (file shares, website logins).  While the firewall is a great front-line defense against attacks coming across the Internet, a snoopy neighrbor or actual adversary can use the wireless network to jump straight past it with very little effort.

Sample scenarios:
  * Organization with a large in-office staff using the wifi which gives them access to internal services.
  * Organization that uses mostly google docs with documents either shared ad-hoc between indiviudals personal or work gmail accounts, or under a organizational account that shares everything with staff.
  * Organization with mostly in-field staff who use an internal mail service and VPN.
