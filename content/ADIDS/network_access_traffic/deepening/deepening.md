## Deepening (80 Minutes) {.deepening}

This section is divided into a section on accessing a wireless network and one on mapping a network once it has been accessed. This is one of the longer activities in the SAFETAG curricula. We tried to tie each exercises to an existing guide or tutorial so that we could support existing translation efforts for the tools used.

##### What trainees will need

  * Computer running Kali Linux
  * Wireless card that can be set to monitor mode

##### What you will need

  * Pre-configure a wireless access point to serve WEP and WPA networks, and enable WPS for WPA. The WPA password should be quickly crackable based on the password attacks above. The WEP network should be configured to use 64 bit encryption to speed the practice.
  * If no WEP network is available, you can use [this pre-build airodump-ng capture file](http://download.aircrack-ng.org/wiki-files/other/test.ivs) and skip the airodump-ng capture.
  * If no WPA network is available, you can use [this file](http://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=wpa-Induction.pcap).
  * Network to target (with permission)
  * It may be helpful to print out copies of the guides tied to each section before hand if there will be limited internet access at the training site.
