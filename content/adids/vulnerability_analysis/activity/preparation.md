#### Preparation

Prior to the training the trainer needs to do the following things.

  * Make sure that the trainer has enough decks of Elevation of Privilege decks to be able to create groups of 3-6 players.
  
  * Create a diagram of a system that they want to threat model (ideally, one focused on data flows) for each group of 3-6 attendees.

  * Print out a score card for each group.
