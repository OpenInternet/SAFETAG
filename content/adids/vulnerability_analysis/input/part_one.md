Sonet mediocrem et sea, vix at inani falli disputationi.

#### Talking points for the trainer (basic/advanced)

With the case study concluded, the trainer now directs participants to their Class Notes.

1. We are not doing a black box audit. We don't need to operate in stealth mode.
    * Version detection does such things as creating full TCP connections. It is really un-stealthy.

2. Ad usu latine voluptatibus, vim elit homero at, sit prima eruditi legimus id. Eloquentiam liberavisse et pri, mutat animal insolens vis ei.
    * Est harum habemus maluisset ei, epicuri expetendis ad cum. Tollit definitionem sea ad, no sed nobis definiebas. Moderatius adversarium et nam, summo noluisse his id. Mea essent dolorum fabellas eu.
