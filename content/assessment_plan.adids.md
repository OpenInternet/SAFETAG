## Activity {.activity}

<?The activities focus on introducing the user to the scope of this threat or section using an activity that lets them explore the concept without the tool so that they can start tool usage with an existing set of use cases in mind.?>

## Discussion {.discussion}

<?SAFETAG specific: For Audit discussions the auditor will provide scenerios that allow a trainee to explore ways they would use/focus a auditing technique with the identified risks in the case study provided.?>

## Input {.input}

<?This is usually the lecture part of the session. The trainer presents on issues, sub-topics and more advanced concepts related to focus of the session.?>

## Deepening {.deepening}

#### Hands on Training

<?Hands-on training on various components of the tool. This will be a moderately collaborative segment where the trainees will have documentation and be encouraged to explore the tool.?>

##### What you will need

##### Conducting a mock interview

A trainee will conduct a mock interview of a trainer to allow the group to see and discuss an interview while it is in action. 

##### Conducting initial interviews

Get individuals from the hosting organization for the trainee's to interview. Each trainee will interview a different person, if possible.

##### Building an initial assessment plan

Each trainee will be given a copy fo the interviews. Using the interviews the trainee's will build an initial assessment plan. 

##### Presenting & Negotiating the assessment plan

The trainees will have a mock presentation and negotiation of their assessment plans with the trainer/s.

## Synthesis {.synthesis}

<?A good training habit is to always summarize the session. Talk about what happened in the session, some of the results of the discussion, what issues were discussed, what solutions were made, and give some more time for participants to ask more questions before the session is closed.?>
