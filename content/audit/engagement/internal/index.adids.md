# The Local Assessment

The internal assessment methodology focuses on the security of individual user's devices and their network traffic.

This section serves two main purposes.

First, for organizations with weak perimeter controls, it often represents the only remaining line of defense between an attacker and whatever sensitive data are stored or transmitted internally.

Secondly, your local assessment provides an opportunity to advocate for the principle of “defense in depth.” Even where perimeter defenses are strong, organizations that rely too heavily on that single point-of-failure should be encouraged to consider the brittleness of their digital security.

To do this your local assessment will focus on the security of individual users’ devices and their network traffic.
