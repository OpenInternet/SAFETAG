# The Local Assessment

For many commercial enterprises, threats that depend on physical access to devices are considered the least probable (albeit the most potentially severe) digital security risks. So much so, that many security specialists concede, with a shrug, that there is no proper defense against an attacker with physical access to sensitive hardware.

While there is some truth to this, it is not particularly useful advice for small scale civil society organizations or independent media houses. The risks that advocacy and media organizations face are far more varied, and the cost of lost information can be crippling to their ability to operate. As such, these risks have high severity, despite their equally high probability for these organizations.

Physical access threats covered in this section include, among others:

  * removal of computers, smartphones, servers, or backup hardrives containing sensitive information;
  * access to computers, smartphones, servers, or backup hardrives of the organization;
  * sniffing the unencrypted wireless traffic of smartphones or laptops;
