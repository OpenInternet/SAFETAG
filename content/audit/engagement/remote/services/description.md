This section includes services administered by the organization itself (such as a Microsoft Exchange email server at a data center, an HTTP proxy on a virtual private server (VPS) or a colocated Web server) and “cloud services” used by members or partners of the organization but not administrated by its IT staff, such as a hosted Wordpress blog, a Yahoo! email account, or a Crowdmap Ushahidi deployment.

```alert
The organization might not be in a position to give you meaningful “permission” to carry out an active remote assessment of "cloud services" used within the organization.
```

Because the auditor is doing this work remotely it is important to only run "safe" tests that have no possibility of causing damage to the network.
