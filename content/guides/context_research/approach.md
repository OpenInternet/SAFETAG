Gathering contextual information to inform your audit.

This part of the audit includes

identifying regional data sources for gathering information about an organization which informs the remote assessment phase.


Threats to Host:

Explore the legal, political, reputation, and technological threats to the host.

- Identify possible risks to the host by taking part in an audit.

Threats to Auditor:

- Identify risks to the auditor if they conduct an audit for this organization in this location.


- Security Updates (ISC, )




#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Identify potentially hostile actors, including government authorities, organized crime, rebel groups, and irregular forces.

Identify risks associated with reporting in the location. Such risks could include outbreak of hostilities/escalation of conflict; abduction/kidnapping; interactions with hostile authorities (problems crossing borders/checkpoints, arrest, detention); physical or electronic surveillance; confiscation/misuse of sensitive information; health risks; dangers associated with various means of transportation; common crime.

 Security for local contacts

Identify risks that people working or interacting with you (local translators, drivers, sources, witnesses, etc.) may face. Assess the possible actors who could be involved, and include any such prior surveillance, actions, or attacks.
2.4. Research risks

Specifically address the risks associated with conducting your work (conducting interviews, taking photographs, filming, visiting news scenes, obtaining and carrying documents and photographs that may have evidentiary value).

2.5. Profiles

Explain how your own profile, the profiles of other members of your team, and that of your news organization may increase or decrease the risk.

Threat Capability Analysis

Once a threat community has been identified, the capabilities of said community must also be analyzed in order to build an accurate threat model that reflects the actual probability of such a community/agent to successfully act upon the organization and compromise it. This analysis requires both a technical analysis as well as an opportunity analysis (where applicable).
Analysis of tools in use

Any tools that are known to be available to the threat community/agent are to be included here. Additionally, tools that may be freely available should be analyzed for the required skill level needed to be able to utilize them to their potential, and mapped in the threat capability.
Availability to relevant exploits/payloads

The threat community/agent should be analyzed in terms of its capability to either obtain or develop exploits for the environment relevant to the organization. Additionally, accessibility to such exploits/payloads through 3rd parties, business partners, or underground communities should also be to taken into account in this analysis.
Communication mechanisms

An analysis of communication mechanisms available to the threat agent/community should be made to evaluate the complexity of attacks against an organization. These communication mechanisms range from simple and openly available technologies such as encryption, through to specialist tools and services such as bulletproof hosting, use of drop-sites, and the use of known or unknown botnets to perform attacks or mask source information. For example, as part of testing we test to see what the overall attack surface for an organization is from the outside. However, there is another whole component that is often times missed. What types of threats can exist post exploitation? This falls under the context of detecting exfiltration channels. Coincidentally, penetration testers are uniquely situated to test an organizations capability to detect command and control channels of today's modern malware. When this is in scope, we recommend the tester create a series of malware specimens that increase the level of obfuscation used to hide C2. The goal is to create malware that is easily detected, then increase the obfuscation to the point where detection no longer occurs.

Motivation Modeling

The possible motivation of threat agents/communities should be noted for further analysis. Motivations of attackers are constantly changing, as can be seen by the increase in hacktivism branded attacks by groups such as Anonymous and Antisec. There will be subtle differences in unique motivations based on each organization and/or vertical market, some common motivations include :

    Profit (direct or indirect)
    Hacktivism
    Direct grudge
    Fun / Reputation
    Further access to partner/connected systems

     

Finding relevant news of comparable Organizations being compromised

In order to provide a complete threat model, a comparison to other organizations within the same industry vertical should be provided. This comparison should include any relevant incidents or news related to such organizations and the challenges they face. Such a comparison is used to validate the threat model and offer a baseline for the organization to compare itself to (taking into account that this publicly available information only represents a portion of the actual threats and incidents the compared organization actually face).
