Analysis of context is the foundation of effective risk management. As auditors work they will develop assumptions based upon their experience. It is important that an audit is based on information that is current and accurate.

Checking these assumptions by keeping track of regional and technological context will ensure that an auditor is basing their audits on accurate assessments of the conditions the organization faces and that they are making informed operational security considerations.
