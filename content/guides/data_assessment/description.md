An attacker who obtains a staff laptop, workstation, or backup drive will be able to read, record or modify any sensitive information on the device, even if that staff member has set a strong Windows password. This applies to threats involving loss, theft and confiscation, but also to “checkpoint” scenarios in which the attacker may only have access for a few minutes. Furthermore, in the event of a burglary or office raid, an attacker could easily obtain all sensitive information on the organization’s laptops within a few hours. And, if she were able to enter and leave the building without being noticed, %{organization} might not even realize that its data had been compromised.
