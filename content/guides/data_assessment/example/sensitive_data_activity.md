## Data Assessment Activity

This activity is taken from the [Level Up Project](https://level-up.cc). The activity is called [Backup Matrix: Creating an Information Map](https://www.level-up.cc/leading-trainings/training-curriculum/activity/backup-matrix). 

### Duration: 

40 minutes

### Summary: 

In this exercise, participants will think about the information/data they keep and where they keep it.

*Note:* The depth of discussion in this exercise will vary depending on group dynamics. In an ideal scenario, the participants have a high level of trust with each other and will be comfortable speaking freely. In situations in which participants are unfamiliar to one another, trainers may want to try to break a larger group up into teams or small groups that share similar situations.

### Materials to Prepare:

  * Stickies
  * Markers
  * Flipchart paper
  * One larger sheet of paper taped to wall in landscape orientation, with or without prepared titles. (For an example with prepared headings, see the matrix below.) The axis denoting the relative sensitivity of data is Optional, with steps in the activity highlighted below. This adds time to the activity, but can help reinforce Risk Management as a theme during your training.



|Relative Sensitivity|Computer Hard Drive|USB / External Drive|Cloud Storage|Another (e.g. Smartphone, Print, etc. depending on group)|

|Low||||

### Running the Activity

  @. Explain to participants that we're going to conduct an information mapping activity to get a sense of where our important information actually is.
  @. Start by listing the different places where our information is stored, according to participants. If no suggestions are forthcoming, we can prompt participants with the obvious stuff:
    * Computer hard drives
    * USB flash drives
    * External hard drives
    * Cellphones
    * CDs & DVDs (and BDs)
    * Our email inbox
    * The Cloud: Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive, etc
    * Physical copies (or “hard copies”) in the office
    * Multimedia: Video tapes, audio recordings, photographs, etc.
  @. Add these titles to the sheet or whiteboard and construct the matrix (see the figure above) around them if you have not already done so.
  @. Then elicit from participants what type of information or data they have in each of these places. For example:
    * Email
    * Contact details, such as a member database
    * Reports/research
    * Accounts/spreadsheets
    * Videos
    * Images
    * Private messages on Facebook, etc.
  @. To encourage participant interaction, write one example on a sticky and place it in the appropriate box in the matrix. Then, ask whether there is another copy of this data somewhere. If there is, you can use another sticky ([preferably one of a different color) and put it wherever they keep the duplicate. You can use this moment to teach the difference between master copies and duplicates.
  @. Repeat this process with another example, hopefully provided by a participant.
  @. Optional if you're including the "sensitive / non-sensitive" axis. Looking at the two examples, introduce the axis representing sensitivity. The higher on the chart, the more sensitive the data.
    * Place the two stickies on this axis representing their relative sensitivity.
  @. Next, divide the group into smaller teams (it helps if there are relatively clear thematic distinctions within the group, such as nationality, type of work, area of interest, etc.) Have a matrix for each group. Then explain the next steps:
    * They will each be given two sets of stickies and should think of the 5 most important types of data they work with.
    * They should write ONE type per sticky
    * For any type that has a duplicate location, they should represent this with a different colored sticky. For instance, all ‘master’ or primary versions of the data might be pink and all the duplicates might be yellow.
    * When they each have their top 5, they should go to the team's matrix and place the stickies into the relevant boxes.
  @. Give participants 5-10 minutes to work on identifying their types of data and then let them come up to stick their results onto the matrixes whenever they're ready.
  @. Once the time is up, you should have one completed matrix per team. It might be useful to go from team to team and identify interesting characteristics—note where there is particularly large dependence on one device, or where there's a lack of yellow stickies, etc.
  @. Explain that this gives us an idea of where our data is. Elicit whether or not this is all the data we generate? Of course it isn't: It's only a small percentage.
  @. Take the example of one of the teams' matrixes. Call out the information that they are keeping on their computer's hard drive (which will usually be the fullest one).
  @. Now, elicit some of the things that can cause a computer to stop working. Maybe take a show of hands: Who has had this happen to them?
    * Virus or malware attack destroyed a computer or some data
    * Stolen computer, confiscated computer
    * Infrastructural problems, like a power failure broke a computer
    * Inexplicably bricked computer, etc.
  @. So, what if any of the above happens? What happens to all this data?
    * Dramatically remove each of the stickies from the column, maybe throw them on the floor, etc.
    * Gesture to the remaining stickies in the other columns. "This is all we're left with!!"
    * So what can we do to avoid this? We should put more copies into different locations. This is called backing up!


#### Optional Teaching Moment: 

**Sensitive data in the wrong hands:** The "sensitive / non-sensitive" distinction in the matrix is optional and should only be done with enough time to deal with a discussion about the relative sensitivity of information. It can also be presented as a scale rather than a dichotomy.
  * Take the example of a second team's data if possible, and/or another column on the matrix.
  * What if I steal your phone/hard drive?
  * Remove the stickies from the column but keep them in your hand and read them. Now I have this information. What can I do with it? And what are you left with?


### Discussion

#### Duration: 

10 minutes

#### Some questions to lead a quick discussion on the issue:

  * How would it feel to lose all this information?
  * Has anything similar happened before, are there any personal examples we can learn from?
  * If they were doing the exercise again, what would they do differently? What would they back up?
