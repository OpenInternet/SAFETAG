The auditor conducts interviews with a management staff member (usually their primary point of contact), and the lead technical staff member when available.

The management interview explores what issue areas the organization works on, how they currently use technology, the importance of digital media for the organization's work, and their practices for building skill/capacity among their staff.

In the technical interview, the auditor explores what technology the organization already uses (both officially and as "shadow infrastructure" such as dropbox), their history with digital security, and any historical obstacles with adoption or use of new technology.

In both interviews, the auditor should explore how the organization perceives their current threat landscape - who are they worried about (adversarial groups opposed to their mission/community, their domestic government, foreign governments...), and what risks they perceive as active and credible - especially around any issues that have happened to their staff or partners in the past.
