Device broadcasts previously used WiFi network names

Each wireless device maintains a “memory” of what networks it has successfully connected to. When it is connecting to a network, it sends out “probes” to all of the networks it has in this memory. These probes can reveal personal, organizational, and locational information that, taken in context, can be dangerous or lead to other vulnerabilities.
