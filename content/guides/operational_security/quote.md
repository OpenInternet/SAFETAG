"*Also be aware that local groups may not be able to accurately gauge the safety of their communications with you. Sometimes they underestimate the likelihood of risk - at other times, they can wildly overestimate the risk. Either way, trainers need to navigate this issues carefully and respectfully with a "do no harm" approach that respects the reported needs, context, and experiences of your local contact and potential trainees.*
 
*Some easy tools that may reduce (but not guarantee) the safety of communications with a local contact (assuming that their device has not been compromised) is chat with [OTR](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/) or [Cryptocat](https://crypto.cat/), as these are two of the easier communication tools to set up and use without advanced technical skills. (Secure encrypted VoIP using [Ostel](https://ostel.co/) is a strong alternative that is easy enough for most users to set up and use as well, although it requires more steps than the previous recommendations.) In any case, it's important to always provide an "opt-out" of handing over sensitive information.*" - _Needs Assessment: Level-Up_ [^event_planning_input]
