SAFETAG uses a customized combination of selected assessment techniques derived from standards in the security auditing world and best-practices for working with small scale at-risk organizations to provide organization driven risk assessment and mitigation consultation.

The SAFETAG process, as seen in Figure 1, requires both technical and facilitation expertise. As such, while the process is built to allow a single auditor, the process can easily be split between a facilitator/trainer and a technical auditor. In fact, if an auditor does not have both the required technical expertise and experience facilitating structured activities with at-risk groups, we **highly recommend** working with a specialist who can fill the missing role. *Inexperienced or untrained auditors can possibly hinder the mission of the host organization or put them at risk.*
