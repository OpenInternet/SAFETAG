The physical assessment methodology is focused on how to mitigate against threats that occur because of the arrangement of digital assets in the physical world. 

  * How are daily devices used and stored?
  * Where are they when employees go home?
  * Are there active network jacks that are unused?
  * Are they within easy access to the public?
  * Are they in places where people would not notice if there was somthing plugged into them?
  * How to make sure you can't do your work if local data is lost.
    * " is the backup drive for the whole organization laying unencrypted and unplugged on the desk of the executive director and/or sysadmin?"
  * Where are the servers that host the organizations assets.
  * Is the location locked, if so, who has the key, etc.


Walkthrough


### During the day ###
As part of your first day, have your point of contact walk you around the office - this is primarily a chance to understand the office layout and meet the rest of the staff, but take mental note of the devices in use and laying out on desks as you walk around the office.  Note as well the location and access to components such as servers and networking components.

Taking actual notes may make the staff feel that you are judging them, so refrain from this if possible, especially if this is your first interaction.

### Outside of work hours ###

Without the knowledge of the staff, also schedule a time with your primary point of contact to visit the office when all (or at least most) staff are not present.  This could be before the staff arrives in the morning, or after hours (perhaps have drinks or dinner with your POC, and come back to check the organization afterwards). Other significantly less ideal options could be during a lunch break or a meeting when the staff are offsite or in a conference room.

During this time, go back through the office (taking notes for the audit this time) to see how devices are outside of the work day (are desktops and laptops unsecured, still on, logged in?).  Are backup drives or other storage media easily accessible? Are doors to server rooms/closets locked?  Are keys to these locked cabinets/rooms visible?

Also note and test network ports that are not in use, looking especially for ones which are not in plain sight.

### Discuss Office Access ###

Working with your POC and other relevant staff (administrative/operational staff, IT staff), enumerate list of everyone who has independent access to the office space (i.e. who is able to unlock the space).  This may include cleaning or other service personnel.  Shared office spaces present unique challenges, and access policies and procedures for the building housing the office may also become relevant.
