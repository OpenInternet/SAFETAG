While the SAFETAG framework is focused on the security of data, the physicality of devices, backup drives, servers, and even hard-wired networks cannot be overlooked.

Organizations face a variety of risks of malicious interference and device seizure, even within their office space.  Easily accessible open 
network ports, particularly in more publicly accessible areas of the office provide entry points into trusted networks, and an insecure 
external backup drive could provide an adversary more valuable information than any amount of network or account based attacks would.

Ensuring that devices with data are physically secured and access to network ports, devices, and servers is limited provides a baseline level of protection from theft. Drive encryption, covered under Device Assessment, provides additional security.
