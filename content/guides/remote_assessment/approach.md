The remote assessment methodology focuses on direct observation of an organization and their infrstructure. This methodology uses "Open Source Intelligence" to gather as much information as the auditor can about an organization. This information is used to inform many of the following sections and can be done remotely. 

  * Re-route your traffic to avoid being blocked when doing automated recon
    * VPN's, Tor, etc.
  * Identify availability of staff, partner, beneficiary, and current project information online. [^PETS_logical_intel]
  * Examine metadata on files the organization has posted online.
  * Search "paste-bin" sites for leaked internal information or existing exploitation of their infrastructure.
  * Create API keys for Recon-ng services to be used. [^recon-ng_API_keys]
  * Use recon-ng to do automated web-based open source reconnaissance. [^recon-ng_data_flow]
  * Identify services being hosted or used by an organization and information about those services (e.g current versions of those services.)
  * Run vulnerability scans against websites hosted by the organization.
  * Run vulnerability scans against servers run by the organization.
