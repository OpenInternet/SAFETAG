Once an auditor has left the report acts as documentation of what an auditor accomplished, a guide for tying digital vulnerabilities to actual risks, a roadmap towards greater security, a task-list for technologists and trainers paid to get the host there, proof of need for funders, and a checklist for validating that threats have been addressed. The report has many audiences who will need to use it in different ways. This is the auditors chance to continue a conversation (albeit a static one) even if the organization never talks to the auditor again. If written with care it can be a tool to encourage agency and guide adoption.
