"*The assessment plan should answer these basic questions:*

1. *What is the scope of the assessment?*
2. *Who is authorized to conduct the assessment?* 
3. *What are the assessmentâ€™s logistics?*
4. *How should sensitive data be handled?* 
5. *What should occur in the event of an incident?*" [^NIST_SP_800-115]
