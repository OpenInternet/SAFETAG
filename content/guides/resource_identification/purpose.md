SAFETAG is an auditing framework designed to connect small civil society organizations and independent media outlets to the digital security services they need. Often small organization do not even know where to start looking for support technical or security concerns. SAFETAG trainers can act as a bridge between these organizations and trusted digital security trainers, technicians, and rapid response groups.

A SAFETAG auditor has an opportunity to act as a conduit between civil society organizations in need and organizations providing digital security training, technological support, legal assistance, and incident response. As SAFETAG auditors develop deep knowledge of regional and global resources available the organizations they audit will have a greater chance of identifying resources that they can use. As auditors share resources they have identified back to the SAFETAG network each auditors possible impact can be increased.
