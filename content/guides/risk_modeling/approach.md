Carry out activities that allow you to do the following:

  * Identify and map critical organizational *process'*.
  * Identify *threats* to those process'.
  * Identify the *impact* to the organization if those threats occur.
    * Rank the severity of the impacts identified.
  * Identify *adversaries* (people or groups) who may attempt to carry out threats.
  * Identify the actual *risk* of your adversaries carrying out threats against you.

The order which you identify each component will vary depending upon what the host participants want to focus on first.

After the activities are complete the auditor has tasks that build upon the outputs of the activities.

  * Create a risk matrix using *risk* and *impacts*.
  * Clean up critical process maps for use in reporting.
  * Create a list of all services or assets that were identified during the activity that were not already known by the auditor.
