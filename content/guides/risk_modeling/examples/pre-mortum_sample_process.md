## ACTIVITY (XX MINUTES)


### Risk Modeling Using the Pre-Mortum Strategy


#### Preparation

##### Additional Material

  * Chart Paper \ whiteboard.
  * Marker pens \ whiteboard markers.
  * Multiple colors of post its.
  * Camera for documenting the process.
  
#### Getting Started

  * Prepare a flipchart / space on the white-board to keep track of process', threats, impacts, and adversaries that are identified during other activities. Participants can easily get ahead of the process as they explore individual ideas. Keeping a space for these "upcoming" activities will help re-center them on the activity at hand.

#### Conducting the Activity

**Pre-Mortum Strategy: (20 Minutes)** The pre-mortum strategy was devised to take participants out of a perspective of defending their plans and strategies and shielding themselves from flaws. They are given "a perspective where they [are] actively searching for flaws in their own plan." [^pre-mortum]

  * Explain the pre-mortum activity. The participants are to imagine that it is months into the future and they have continued doing their work as normal. And something happened that left them entirely unable to function or functioning at a very poor level. "That is all they know; they have to explain what has happened." [^pre-mortum]
  * Create a broad list of possible explanations for what has happened.
  * Identify the most likely causes.
  * List the process' that would have to fail for those causes to take effect.
  * Identify process' that are central to the failures and write them on a list of *critical process'.*

**Process Mapping (Interaction):** Explanation

  * Pick a process from the list of *critical process'* identified above.
  * Clearly identify the process name on the whiteboard or flipchart.
  * Create a list of individuals who take part in the process.
  * Draw a symbol of the person.
  * Write a label describing their role or title.
  * Draw lines with arrows connecting individuals who interact with each other in this process.
  * Label the lines with words describing the interaction.
  * Write numbers on the interactions to show the order they occur in.
  * Continue this activitiy with the next *critical process.*

  * **NOTES:**
    * You can add follow-on processes' to examine if they are identified as critical by the participants during this activity.
	* Put people on post-its to make them moveable.
    * Verbally walk the participants through the completed process so you ensure you didn't miss anything.
    * Take quick notes to remind yourself of any key points not clearly marked on the map before they move on to the next activity. 
    * After completing all the key events take a photo of the whiteboard / store the chart-paper for later documentation.

**Threat Identification:** 

  * Explain the types of threats.
    * Confidentiality: If unauthorized individuals find out an asset/process.
    * Control: If an asset/process can be accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    * Integrity: If an asset/process is changed without permission.
    * Availability: If an asset/process becomes unavailable.
    * Consistency: If an asset/process becomes unreliable.
	* Audit: If you cannot verify that an asset/process is secure.
  * Give participants a "cheat sheet" of risks.
  * Identify a "interaction line" from the process map to start with.
  * Generate a list of threats that would cause that interaction to fail.
  * Mark the back of the post it with the interaction name or number.
  * Write the threat and their impact on post-its and arrange them in an orderly way.
  * If multiple risks cause the same consequence create a new post-it near the new risk.
  * Continue doing this for all the interactions in the critical process'.
  * Discuss and rearrange threats as groupings emerge.
  * Label threat clusters that appear.
  
  * **NOTES:**
    * If any of the impacts identified in the pre-mortum are not covered ask participants where they would go.
    * Take photos of the threats once you have finished enumerating them.
    * Write risks on one set of post-its and impacts on another color of post it's to make it easy to keep track.

**Impact Identification:** This exercise has the trainee lead the participants on a brainstorming of hypothetical consequences (impacts) when the threats identified earlier occur.

  * Give participants a pen and three sticky note pads.
  * Explain the topic and the categories. [^GPR_8_impacts]
    * Staff/People - (which includes families, friends, and beneficiaries): temporary or permanent
physical injury, temporary or longer-term psychological damage, death, legal costs, cost of medical treatment, loss of morale or trust in management.
    * Organization - loss of or damage to assets, operational inefficiency, loss of programme quality or outright suspension; loss of reputation; loss of funding.
    * Program - reduced program quality, temporary suspension of the program, forced termination of the program.
  * Instruct each person to generate impacts based upon the exiting threat clustering from **Threat Identification.**
  * Include only one impact per sticky note.
  * Have one participant quickly describe then place an impact on the board writing along side it the threat that causes it.
  * Invite others to place similar/the same impacts in proximity and quickly describe how it can occurs.
  * Repeat the process until all impacts are included.
  * Discuss and rearrange impacts as groupings emerge.
  * Label impact clusters that appear.
  
  * **NOTES:**
    * Tell participants to write multiple impacts per color.
	* Look for opportunities to create sub-groups.
	* Limit the time frame for discussion.
    * Take photos of the impact clusters once you have finished enumerating them.

**Adversary Exploration (Likelyhood):** 

  * Give participants a pen and three sticky note pads.
  * Explain the topic and the categories. [^GPR_8_Likelihood]
    * "History – a past incidence or pattern of attacks on similar organizations."
    * "Intent – specific threats, a demonstrated intention or mindset to attack."
    * "Capability – the wherewithal to carry out an attack."
  * Instruct each person to generate adversaries who have demonstrated likelihood to impact their work or one of the process'.
  * Include only one adversary per sticky note.
  * Have one participant quickly describe then place an adversary on the board.
  * Invite others to place similar/the same adversaries in proximity and quickly describe their demonstrated likelihood if a different category or reason.
  * Repeat the process until all adversaries are included.
  * Discuss and rearrange adversaries as groupings emerge.
  * Label adversary clusters that appear.
  
  * **NOTES:**
    * Tell participants to write multiple adversaries per color.
	* Tell participants to only write the adversaries name, not the explanation.
	* Limit the time frame for discussion.
    * Take photos of the adversary clusters once you have finished enumerating them.

**Impact Ranking:** The goal of this exercise is to have the trainee lead the host organization in classifying the severity of the possible impacts from the threats they have just explored. 

  * Create a post it for each impact.
  * Place two points on the wall. On one side are "Inconvenient" impacts that disrupt the organization in a very small way. On the other side are "critical" impacts that may pose life-safety risks to employee's, partners, or the general public.
  * The low end of the scale may include  a fire alarm may cause the staff to lose a half an hour of work time, but does not impact any short or long-term activities.
  * The high end of the scale would include events such as a fire that destroys the organizations headquarters and endangers staffs lives or legal issues that cause termination of the program.
  * Place each item along the severity line from least to most severe impact.
  * Give each item its own place on the scale. No two items can be the same severity.

  * **NOTES:**
	* Listen carefully to every point of deliberation. 
    * As risks are placed on the wall, the trainee can use other already ranked risks to help participants identify the right place. "Is a robbery more or less likely than a fire?"
    * Take photos of the impact scale once you have finished it.
