## ACTIVITY (XX MINUTES)

### Critical Process Mapping

The goal of this exercise is for the auditor to lead the host participants in "brain-storming" and mapping all the processes that are critical for the organization to carry out their work.

#### Preparation


##### Additional Material

  * Chart Paper \ whiteboard.
  * Marker pens \ whiteboard markers.

#### Getting Started


#### Conducting the Activity


  * **List all organizational process’:** The goal of this exercise is for the auditor to lead the host participants in "brain-storming" a list of all the processes the organization takes part in to carry out their work. It is important to remember this is a brainstorming session of all of the processes that occur in the organization.

    * Quickly identify the main purpose of the organization. If the organization is an online newspaper, the purpose then is to create, distribute, and diversify the content they are providing to their consumers.

    * Write out the list of all the processes that would occur in a very busy week at the office. This is a brainstorming session with your participants so it is important to get them to identify as many different processes at the beginning.

    * Once a complete list has been created, the auditor will then go through through to identify with the participants the critical processes within the organization – that is, without these processes the organization would not be able to function or function at a very poor level

  * **Determine critical process':** During this exercise the aim is for the auditor to lead the attendees in narrowing down the subset of activities to those that are crucial to their work.

    * step 1
    * step 2
    * step 3
    * step etc.

*NOTE:* If an auditor does not ensure that the uniquely identified subset of processes speaks to the full range of participants, their recommendations are more likely to be met with resistance.

  * **Map out critical process':** In this exercises the auditor does free-hand mapping for each process guided by the host participants. The auditor needs to make sure that they work to develop a broad understanding of the overall process. This is a time consuming activity, and managing their overall time to complete the entire needs assessment, and respect the time constraints of the staff, is critical.

    * Clearly identify the process name on the whiteboard or flipchart
	* Identify the first and last steps from the participants and write them on the side of the paper to keep the participants on track.
	* Place the "Starting" place on the white paper.
	* Have your participants explain to you what the process is step-by-step, while making a note on the side where there will be follow on processes.
      1. Don’t forget about follow-on processes
      2. List who does each step along side each process
    * Verbally walk the participants through the completed process so you ensure you didn’t miss anything
	* Take quick notes to remind yourself of any key points not clearly marked on the map before they move on to the next activity. 
	* After completing all the key events take a photo of the whiteboard / store the chart-paper for later documentation.

While doing this it is important to consider level of detail you will be mapping out (this should be pre-determined or established so everyone is on the same page)
