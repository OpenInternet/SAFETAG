Having the host organization central to the risk assessment process allows the auditor to put their threats and recommendations into the host own narrative. With greater ownership of the process the staff will be more engaged in addressing the threats identified when the audit is complete. The existing in/formal security practices captured during this process will be used to remove organizational and psyco-social barriers to starting new practices.
