This component allows the auditor to gauge staffs digital security awareness and identify critical data in the organization. This component consists of an activity where the auditor sends the host staff a set of "phishing campaign" style emails. The staff are asked to spot problems in the e-mails at an event that follows and are informed of current malware that they are vulnerable to. This activity is closed with a brainstorm of the critical pieces of data within the organization, where they currently reside, and who should be allowed to know them.
