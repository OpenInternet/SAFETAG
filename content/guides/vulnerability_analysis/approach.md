Basic vulnerability analysis should be occurring along-side the other activities so that evidence can be gathered from the network. Research identifying existing exploits and write ups for the vulnerabilities can happen after the on-site audit to take advantage of the short time the auditor has on site.

  * Search for vulnerabilities in the identified systems.
    * Explore Vulnerability Database.
	  * Search OVAL Database by platform and software.
	  * Explore CVE's to see if system is vulnerable.
	  * Search for recent vendor advisories for software found on systems.
	  * Search Exploit Database's to find examples of exploitation of possible vulnerabilities identified.
    * Explore default configurations.
	  * Identify if systems are using default passwords or users.
      * Use hardening guides & common min-configurations to identify weak/vulnerable configurations.
  * Document Vulnerabilities (per vulnerability)
    * Write Up
      * Summary - A short (two to three sentence) basic overview of the vulnerability.
      * Description - An in-depth (one to three paragraph) overview of the vulnerability.
      * Approach - Step-by-step explanation of the methodology used that is tool agnostic.
	  * Proof - The cleaned up output from tests run to identify the vulnerability.
