Basic vulnerability analysis should be occurring along-side the other activities so that evidence can be gathered from the network. Research identifying existing exploits can happen after the on-site audit to take advantage of the short time the auditor has on site.

  * Explore Vulnerability Database.
    * Search OVAL Database by platform and software.
    * Explore CVE's to see if system is vulnerable.
	* Search for recent vendor advisories for software found on systems.
	* Search Exploit Database's to find examples of exploitation of possible vulnerabilities identified.
  * Explore default configurations.
	* Identify if systems are using default passwords or users.
    * Use hardening guides & common min-configurations to identify weak/vulnerable configurations.
