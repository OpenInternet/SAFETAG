## Summary ##
This component allows an auditor to quickly identify common web vulnerabilities using the OWASP framework - either by a relatively intense spidering of the website or through a more tailored use of the proxy functionality of the tool.

## Description ##



## Approach ##
 * Agree on the site(s) to scan and determine the intensity of the process
 * Ensure documented permission and schedule an appropriate time with the site host.
 * Run automated or proxied investigation of the site(s)
 * Examine revealed information and issues, determining any that are critical.

## Instructions ##

For a website that can be expected to withstand a dedicated spidering of its content, the automated mode will dig through 

## Recommendations ##
Core recommendations are to always use well-supported, open source tools, and to minimize the use of interactive sites if not actually necessary. Removal of unused tools, demos, and default systems is highly encouraged.

For interactive sites, content management systems and other frameworks, make sure the site is actively maintained, updated to the latest software and security patches regularly, and that the user permissions are reviewed periodically.

OWASP-ZAP provides results of security problems it finds with differing levels of severity (https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/wiki/HelpStartConceptsAlerts). Make special note of "High" severity issues and research the recommendations OWASP provides.
