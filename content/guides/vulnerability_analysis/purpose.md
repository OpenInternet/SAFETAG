Usually penetration tests exploit possible vulnerabilities to confirm their existence. [^NIST_exploit_confirm] But, the use of exploits puts the organization's systems at a level of increased risk [^NIST_pen_test_danger] that is unacceptable when neither the organization nor the auditor has the time or finances to address the issue. The SAFETAG methodology only uses relatively safe exploitation of vulnerabilities for targeted outcomes. For instance, cracking the wireless access point password allows us to demonstrate the importance of good passwords without singling out any individual's passwords. [^network-access]
