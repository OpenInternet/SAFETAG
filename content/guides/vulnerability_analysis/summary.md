This component allows the auditor to discover possible flaws in host or service configuration, application design, or network design.

This component consists of comparing the services, applications, and operating systems of identified hosts against a variety of online and offline resources (vulnerability and exploit databases, vendor advisories, and virtualized replica testing) to identify if known vulnerabilities exist.  Basic vulnerability analysis should be occurring along-side the other activities so that evidence can be gathered from the network, however, deeper research into identifying existing exploits can and should happen after the on-site audit to fully take advantage of the short time the auditor has on site.
