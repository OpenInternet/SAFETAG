### why the topic matters

It is not uncommon for a cash-strapped human rights NGO to outsource most of its IT infrastructure to a cloud provider, such as Google Apps, or to whatever jumble of ad hoc services (Dropbox, Yahoo! mail, Wordpress, Basecamp, etc.) that its staff might already have been using. On the other end of the spectrum, a better-resourced organization is more likely to host its critical services at a remote data center somewhere.

<!-- TODO finish this paragraph about how external services can have vulnerabiities that leak data.-->
These services are sometimes just as likely to have insecure connections
