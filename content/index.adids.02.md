# 2. Operational Security [STUB]

    * Operational Security Basics
	* Accessable Security & Security Alienation
    * Securing Data in Motion
	* Securing Data at Rest

## Activity {.activity}

<?The activities focus on introducing the user to the scope of this threat or section using an activity that lets them explore the concept without the tool so that they can start tool usage with an existing set of use cases in mind.?>

  * Provide the trainees with a pre-build asset and process model along with a threat. The trainees will then work through pre-audit, audit, and post-audit to brainstorm how to best protect the data and people.
  * One of the trainees will be given a card where even knowing them is something that they have to address in their operational security plan.

## Discussion {.discussion}

<?SAFETAG specific: For Audit discussions the auditor will provide scenerios that allow a trainee to explore ways they would use/focus a auditing technique with the identified risks in the case study provided.?>

## Input {.input}

<?This is usually the lecture part of the session. The trainer presents on issues, sub-topics and more advanced concepts related to focus of the session.?>

  * Accessable Security
  If the process is too difficult members of the organization will "circumvent" it. You need to do a basic assessment of their capabilities and then base the level of operational security on that.
  * Security Alienation

  * Data In motion
    * Basic Usable Tools
      * CryptoCat
	    * How to teach installation.
    * Advanced tools
    (If they are already using them, or there is time for a training)
      * GPG
  * Data At Rest
    * Basic Usable Tools
      * MiniLock
        * How to teach installation.
        * How to quickly get them to use a good initial password.
    * Advanced tools
    (If they are already using them, or there is time for a training)
	  * Truecrypt

## Deepening {.deepening}

#### Hands on Training

<?Hands-on training on various components of the tool. This will be a moderately collaborative segment where the trainees will have documentation and be encouraged to explore the tool.?>

##### What you will need

##### Explaining Cryptocat & MiniLock

##### Setting up Cryptocat & MiniLock

##### Walking Someone Through Cryptocat & MiniLock Setup

Using the trainers or other trainees.

##### Using Cryptocat & MiniLock

##### Walking Someone Through Proper Cryptocat & MiniLock Use

Using the trainers or other trainees.

#### Live Practice
<?A timed practice session on a live target?>

It would be great to get volunteers from the host organization to actually have to talk through. This could even be done via e-mail or otherwise remotely for added experience.

##### Capturing Data

##### Writing up Findings

##### Connecting to Assets and Process'

## Synthesis {.synthesis}

<?A good training habit is to always summarize the session. Talk about what happened in the session, some of the results of the discussion, what issues were discussed, what solutions were made, and give some more time for participants to ask more questions before the session is closed.?>
