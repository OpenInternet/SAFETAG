##### What you will need

##### Conducting a mock interview

A trainee will conduct a mock interview of a trainer to allow the group to see and discuss an interview while it is in action. 

##### Conducting initial interviews

Get individuals from the hosting organization for the trainee's to interview. Each trainee will interview a different person, if possible.

##### Building an initial assessment plan

Each trainee will be given a copy fo the interviews. Using the interviews the trainee's will build an initial assessment plan. 

##### Presenting & Negotiating the assessment plan

The trainees will have a mock presentation and negotiation of their assessment plans with the trainer/s.

## Synthesis {.synthesis}

<?A good training habit is to always summarize the session. Talk about what happened in the session, some of the results of the discussion, what issues were discussed, what solutions were made, and give some more time for participants to ask more questions before the session is closed.?>
