## Activity  [stub] {.activity}

Auditors are provided basic information about an organization and a basic assessment plan for that organization for an audit.  After a short time looking it over they will each be given a persona to become as "employees" for that organization. The trainer will then run a needs assessment activity (both asset, process, and risk analysis) with the "staff."

## Synthesis [stub] {.synthesis}

<?A good training habit is to always summarize the session. Talk about what happened in the session, some of the results of the discussion, what issues were discussed, what solutions were made, and give some more time for participants to ask more questions before the session is closed.?>
