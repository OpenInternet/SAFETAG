<?The activities focus on introducing the user to the scope of this threat or section using an activity that lets them explore the concept without the tool so that they can start tool usage with an existing set of use cases in mind.?>

Auditors are provided basic information about an organizaiton and a basic assessment plan for that organization for an audit.  After a short time looking it over they will each be given a persona to become as "employees" for that organization. The trainer will then run a threat modeling activity (both asset and process analysis) with the "staff."
