<?This is the the hands-on segment of a session. The deepening will consist of a live experiment with a tool using existing data that has been already parsed, unparsed data, and an opportunity to capture live data from a static target and the housing training organization using the tool.?>

  * Examples with Common Services
    * Mail
	  * Revealing internal services or vulnerable mail servers using MX record assessment.
	  * HTTPS EVERYWHERE!
    * Web
	  * Identifying versions of CMS's and Server software.
	  * Identifying internal web-services
	    * Anonymous DNS transfer
	  * Identifying security of logins
	* Basic security assessment of web services used.
	  * Transparency reports
	  * Server locations
	  * Response to government requests
    * How to tie ease of identification of exploit to likelyhood for report

#### Hands on Training

<?Hands-on training on various components of the tool. This will be a moderately collaborative segment where the trainees will have documentation and be encouraged to explore the tool.?>

##### What you will need

##### Setting up [tool]

##### Configuring [tool]

##### [Using Tool Subsections]

#### Live Practice
<?A timed practice session on a live target?>

##### Capturing Data

##### Writing up Findings

##### Connecting to Assets and Process'

## Synthesis [stub] {.synthesis}

<?A good training habit is to always summarize the session. Talk about what happened in the session, some of the results of the discussion, what issues were discussed, what solutions were made, and give some more time for participants to ask more questions before the session is closed.?>
