# 10. Physical Access

The pysical access componet of SAFETAG is a VERY limited physical security component focused on how to mitigate against threats that occur because of the arrangement of digital assets in the physical world. This is NOT in any way a full physical security audit. SAFETAG auditors are not expected to have in-depth knoweledge of locks or security hardware. The SAFETAG physical security methodology addresses basic physical practices for supporting data/network security and recovery.

  * Server Access
  * Device Access
  * Active Network Jacks
  * Data Access

## Input [stub] {.input}

<?This is usually the lecture part of the session. The trainer presents on issues, sub-topics and more advanced concepts related to focus of the session.?>

  * Device storage
    * Where are devices during the day?
	* Where are devices when an emloyee goes home?
  * Data Storage and security
    * Encrypt and shutdown
  * Controlling unauthorized access to your facilities
  * Contingency and Disaster Recover planning
    * Offsite backups
	* Actually use your backups every once and a while.
  * Documenting and Presenting physical security concerns
    * Photos, video's, maps, etc.

## Deepening [stub] {.deepening}

<?This is the the hands-on segment of a session. The deepening will consist of a live experiment with a tool using existing data that has been already parsed, unparsed data, and an oppourtunity to capture live data from a static target and the housing training organization using the tool.?>

Trainees are taken on a tour of the host organizations building and asked to conduct a "walk through assessment" of the organization.

NOTE: This would be far more valuable if supplimented by an after-hours tour by one of the hosts of the organization so that the auditors can identify the physical security practices of the organization.

## Synthesis [stub] {.synthesis}

<?A good training habit is to always summarize the session. Talk about what happened in the session, some of the results of the discussion, what issues were discussed, what solutions were made, and give some more time for participants to ask more questions before the session is closed.?>
