## Activity [stub] {.activity}

<?The activities focus on introducing the user to the scope of this threat or section using an activity that lets them explore the concept without the tool so that they can start tool usage with an existing set of use cases in mind.?>

## Discussion [stub] {.discussion}

<?SAFETAG specific: For Audit discussions the auditor will provide scenerios that allow a trainee to explore ways they would use/focus a auditing technique with the identified risks in the case study provided.?>

## Input [stub] {.input}

<?This is usually the lecture part of the session. The trainer presents on issues, sub-topics and more advanced concepts related to focus of the session.?>

  * Documenting the threat modeling process
    * Showing threat processes
	A report needs to clearly communicating the path between recommendations and the security requirements that were expressed during the asset and processes audit.
	* Quantifying risk based of threat process
	  * Estimated Loss per incident
	  * Estimated probility of Event
  * Technical vs. Managerial vs. Staff Level report
  Splitting up report items by the "ability for data to be used in an attack" so that an overview of needs and how to resolve them can be articulated to key external gorups (board and funders, etc.) without unduely increasing teh risk of attack to the org if intercepted will be vital for orgs getting the support they need.

  * Roadmap
  Reporting as a guide for a follow up assessment
    * Triage
	* Progression roadmap w/ level of effort
	* Long-term solution
	* Skills to look for in the person who will fix this.
  * Training/Skill Development Needed

## Deepening [stub] {.deepening}

<?This is the the hands-on segment of a session. The deepening will consist of a live experiment with a tool using existing data that has been already parsed, unparsed data, and an oppourtunity to capture live data from a static target and the housing training organization using the tool.?>

#### Hands on Training

<?Hands-on training on various components of the tool. This will be a moderately collaborative segment where the trainees will have documentation and be encouraged to explore the tool.?>

This section takes the small report components created throughout the week and has the auditor put them together into a final *mini* report.


##### What you will need

##### Organizing preliminary results

##### Quantifying the threat process

##### Roadmap Development

##### Configuring the SAFETAG report builder

##### Building Reports

##### Collaborative Report Reviewing

##### Collaborative Report Presentation

###### Managerial Presentation

###### Technical Presentation


## Synthesis [stub] {.synthesis}

<?A good training habit is to always summarize the session. Talk about what happened in the session, some of the results of the discussion, what issues were discussed, what solutions were made, and give some more time for participants to ask more questions before the session is closed.?>
