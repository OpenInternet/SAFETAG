The host organization who is allowing active auditing to be done on their network requires as much care, if not more, than an active audit. As such, the trainers will have to have already conducted much of the pre-audit relationship buildign work before the audit takes place.

## Content contained in each SAFETAG Module ##

  * Context

Content for the trainer of auditors.

    * Why the topic matters

    * What the auditor will learn

- Concepts
- Skills

    * Before you start

    * Materials Needed

    * Related Modules

    * Objectives

    * Practical Uses

    * Prerequisite Skills

    * Notes for trainers

  * Activity

The session begins with an activity that is connected to the topic of the session. This is meant to introduce the topic to the participants using interactive exercises. Trainers / facilitators design this beforehand to illustrate some of the issues that they want the participants to start thinking about.

The activities focus on introducing the user to the scope of this threat or section using an activity that lets them explore the concept without the tool so that they can start tool usage with an existing set of use cases in ming.

Activity Description

    * Preparation

Prior to the start of the class the trainer should prepare...

    * Getting Started

Getting starting with the activity.

    * Conducting the Activity

The actual process for the activity.

    * Additional materials

Any materials beyond the norm that the trainers will need.
(example: Cheap plastic sunglasses)

    * Alternatives

Alternative activities to undertake if needed.
(need examples and reasons for this)

    * Options

Ways the activities can be modified to support other needs.
(need examples and reasons for this)

  * Discussion

In this part of your session, everyone talks about what they thought of the activity they just completed. The trainer / facilitator should prepare questions to guide the activity.

SAFETAG specific: For Audit discussions the auditor will provide scenerios that allow a trainee to explore ways they would use/focus a auditing technique with the identified risks in the case study provided.

  * Input

This is usually the lecture part of the session. The trainer presents on issues, sub-topics and more advanced concepts related to focus of the session.

    * What is it?

basic concept

    * What does this consist of?

step-by-step explanation that is tool agnostic of the audit / approach

    * Advanced Concepts

For audit sections we will do the actual tool training and  conduct mini-follow up on the larger safetag audit themes in relationship to that audit.

- Operational Security
- Practices for results cature
- Practices for displaying results
- Incident response for this audit type
- connecting results to the threats dientified
- Translating results to various audiences

  * Deepening

This is the the hands-on segment of a session

The deepening will consist of a live experiment with a tool using existing data that has been already parsed, unparsed data, and an oppourtunity to capture live data from a static target and the housing training organization using the tool.

    * How will it be done?

tool-specific instructions

    * Example

A sample example. This is usually pulled from the audit content

  * Synthesis

A good training habit is to always summarize the session. Talk about what happened in the session, some of the results of the discussion, what issues were discussed, what solutions were made, and give some more time for participants to ask more questions before the session is closed.
