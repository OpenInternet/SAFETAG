## Discussion [stub] {.discussion}

  * How do wireless networks impact security differently from wired?  Note that this extends beyond the LAN/location of the office through the beaconing of wireless devices.
  * How do the various types of internal privlage separation change what "access" means?
  * Where do hosted services help?  Where do they hurt?

<?A good training habit is to always summarize the session. Talk about what happened in the session, some of the results of the discussion, what issues were discussed, what solutions were made, and give some more time for participants to ask more questions before the session is closed.?>

* Limits of wireless cracking in the field (and when to give up)
* Password security
* Defense in depth
