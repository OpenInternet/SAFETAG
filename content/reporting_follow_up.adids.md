<!-- ![](content/images/reporting.png "") -->

  * The Final Report
    * Findings

"What is the level of risk? What do you want to do to address that risk? How are you going to acheive it?" - Threat Modeling: Adam Shostack the Strategies for risk management (pg. 168) 

      * Summary
      * Description
      * Approach
		* Risks should be NEAT ( Necesary, explanitory, actionable, and tested) ->
		  * We are not testing all risks, so how do we best go about this?
	  * Impact
		* Connecting Vulnerabilities to Threats
		* Concretizing Threats
		* How to clearly write about vulnerabilities, tests, and consiquences of exploitation using the auditee's framework
	  * Level of Risk
	    * Guide on how the organization can update their level of risk as conditions change.
	  * Recommendation
	    * Mitigation can also include warning users that things are/might be insecure! eg. Acceptance of risks
		* Identifying the right approach to prioritizing addressing threats
		  * Existing Approaches are on the road-map
		  * Easy First
		  * Critical First
		  * Capacity Driven Roadmaping
	  * Resources
		* Identifying resources
		  * training resources, digital security rapid & long-term response resources, technology hubs, funding sources for supporting these types of organizations, etc. 
		  * in-region
		  * out of region
		* Sorting resources
		* Identifying DIY resources
    * Road Map
  * Follow Up

## Activity [stub] {.activity}

The auditor will provide a needs assessment and organization profile and a set of identified vulnerabilities trainees will then organize the vulnerabilities themselves. 


## Discussion [stub] {.discussion}


## Input [stub] {.input}

<?This is usually the lecture part of the session. The trainer presents on issues, sub-topics and more advanced concepts related to focus of the session.?>

  * Documenting the threat modeling process
    * Showing threat processes
	A report needs to clearly communicating the path between recommendations and the security requirements that were expressed during the asset and processes audit.
	* Quantifying risk based of threat process
	  * Estimated Loss per incident
	  * Estimated probility of Event
  * Technical vs. Managerial vs. Staff Level report
  Splitting up report items by the "ability for data to be used in an attack" so that an overview of needs and how to resolve them can be articulated to key external gorups (board and funders, etc.) without unduely increasing teh risk of attack to the org if intercepted will be vital for orgs getting the support they need.

  * Roadmap
  Reporting as a guide for a follow up assessment
    * Triage
	* Progression roadmap w/ level of effort
	* Long-term solution
	* Skills to look for in the person who will fix this.
  * Training/Skill Development Needed

## Deepening [stub] {.deepening}

<?This is the the hands-on segment of a session. The deepening will consist of a live experiment with a tool using existing data that has been already parsed, unparsed data, and an oppourtunity to capture live data from a static target and the housing training organization using the tool.?>

#### Hands on Training

<?Hands-on training on various components of the tool. This will be a moderately collaborative segment where the trainees will have documentation and be encouraged to explore the tool.?>

This section takes the small report components created throughout the week and has the auditor put them together into a final *mini* report.


##### What you will need

##### Organizing preliminary results

##### Quantifying the threat process

##### Roadmap Development

##### Configuring the SAFETAG report builder

##### Building Reports

##### Collaborative Report Reviewing

##### Collaborative Report Presentation

###### Managerial Presentation

###### Technical Presentation


## Synthesis [stub] {.synthesis}

<?A good training habit is to always summarize the session. Talk about what happened in the session, some of the results of the discussion, what issues were discussed, what solutions were made, and give some more time for participants to ask more questions before the session is closed.?>
