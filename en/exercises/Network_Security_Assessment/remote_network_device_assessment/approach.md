There can be several approaches for this exercise, depending on the scenario.

###### Scenario 0

The organization has contacted the auditor through an intermediary who is familiar with tech and can follow SAFETAG instructions, or the organization has a tech person among their employees.

This scenario is comparable to a situation where the auditor is on site. In this case, the auditor will instruct the intermediary or the tech person in the organization to follow the instructions in the exercise on [Network mapping](#network-mapping) and on [User device assessment](#user-device-assessment).

###### Scenario 1

The organization has someone among their employees who is ready to follow simple instructions, including opening a terminal and pasting commands we will provide them.

In this scenario, the auditor will send simple instructions to the auditee, so as to be able to access the organization's network through a reverse SSH tunnel and assess the LAN and single devices from there. To run the computer used within the organization's network to establish the tunnel, a UNIX system is needed. This will be a Linux live distribution or a Mac computer.

###### Scenario 2

In this scenario, no one at the organization is ready to apply complex instructions. Instead of relying on an individual, the auditor will rely on  tunneling into a device located in the physical space of the auditee. This can be done in two ways:

1. Remote Desktop or remote VPN into targeted Network. Remote Desktop is  tunneling into a targeted machine that lives on the same targeted LAN network  where you wish to scan the network and do the device assessment; the auditor controls the machine remotely and uses it as the auditor machine.
2. VPN to a trusted VPN server. In this case, the auditee will connect one of their machines to a trusted VPN server, and the auditor will connect to the same VPN server, allowing both LANs at the auditee's and auditor's ends to connect.
