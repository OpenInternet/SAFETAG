In this activity, the auditor or the organization draws a map of the office space and notes locations of potentially valuable information or assets.

This activity can be paired with the Guided Tour activity, to reduce the awkwardness of taking notes while walking around the office during the Tour, and if being done remotely, the two separate activities can be used to cross-verify the accuracy of each. This can also be done by an organizational point of contact in advance to provide additional preparation for the auditor.
