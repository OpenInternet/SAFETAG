The auditor interviews and/or requests survey input from organizational representatives, requests supporting documentation (e.g. policies) as relevant, and iterates/repeats as needed.

This activity is used to solidify the auditor's understanding of the physical risks the organization faces in its work as they impact information security:

* Discuss potential risks and history
* Explore the physical office setup
* Determine access controls and related policies (who has access to what, when?)
* Determine where and when staff members work (office, cafe, co-working spaces, home, on travel/remote assignments)

This can be done entirely remotely over secure communications channels (see operational security considerations), and may be useful to be done partially or fully in advance of an in-person audit to further understand operational risks of traveling to the office location.
