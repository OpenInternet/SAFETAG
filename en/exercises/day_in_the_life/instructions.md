As you work with staff members (this pairs well with the device checklist activity), also interview them about the other devices they use, and how they connect to work services - email/webmail, intra/extranet tools, Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) tools like CiviCRM or Salesforce, financial tracking tools, and website management tools.

This can also be done remotely. Ask to have the staff member use a screensharing tool (meet.jit.si or appear.in offer easy-to-use, browser based options) so that you can watch how they interact with their computer and what applications are active in the background.
