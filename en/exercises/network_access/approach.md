  * Determine the security of the wireless access point (WAP).
  * Gain access to the organizations Wireless network access.
  * Test unused ethernet ports for live network connectivity.

*Note*: 
Cracking wireless passwords often take a huge amount of time performing. Consideration such as the encryption password used on the wireless network, (WEP vs WPA) and number of hosts connected to the wireless network. In cracking wireless network, you need to capture a huge amount of "replayed authentication" traffic from the wireless network clients. This is used to gather what you called "IV" or "Initialization Vector". the process of de-authenticating wireless devices connected to the access point may take some time, and it may be not worth your time to crack it. It is recommended that once an organization is using vulnerable authentication method, you can flag it right away as "finding".
