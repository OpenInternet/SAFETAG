Breaking into network requires specialized tools as well as a significant amount of time in capturing authentication packets, and replaying those packets back to the wireless access point. WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) has been found with several vulnerabilities. [The RC4 algorithm that it uses to generate the keystream for encryption is subject to two separate weaknesses](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8aeb/2a27abc2a1d0a8b71047606fbeec0f711e03.pdf).

On the other hand, WPA/WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is also found to be vulnerable to attack known as [KRACK](https://www.krackattacks.com/)(Key Reinstallation Attacks).
