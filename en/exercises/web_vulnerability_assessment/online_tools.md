# Introduction:

Using online tools in assessing web applications is a great way to start your vulnerability assessment. You can profile a web application target by having a clear idea of what comprises a web application, the technologies behind it and from there build particular strategies on conducting your vulnerability assessment. Using online tools are also ways of performing "passive" scans, in which your identity is hidden from the target organization, in cases where there are IDS/IPS, firewalls deployed.
