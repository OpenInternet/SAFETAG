## Responding to Advanced Threats

### Summary
This component allows the auditor to be able to identify, triage, and analyze suspicious behavior on a device or in a network. Depending on the analysis, the auditor may need to further investigate a malware infection, analyze a binary and determine if it is malicious or not, and recommend urgent mitigation steps.

### Purpose
It is very common to find suspicious behaviors, processes, traffic and other ‘weird activities’ during a SAFETAG audit. SAFETAG practitioners should always be on the lookout for suspicious activities as they apply other SAFETAG methods and their activities, from interactions and discussions with staff to hands-on device assessment and traffic analysis.

### The Flow of Information

### Guiding Questions

* Does the organization suspect they already have malware? If so, what evidence supports that?
* Have staff members received suspicious communications, like emails or IMs?
* Based on the context research and the organization's activities, how likely are targeted attacks?
* How much time should be devoted to more complete analysis during the audit itself, and what other factors change that?
* What are the implications of targeted malware for the organization, and for the current assessment process?
* What types of malware should trigger an incident response approach?
