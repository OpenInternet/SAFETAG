## Preparation

### Summary
This component consists of trip preparation activities that are needed to ensure the technical and facilitated components of the audit are able to be conducted effectively and within the on-site time-frame.

### Purpose
A SAFETAG audit has a short time frame. Preparation is vital to ensure that time on the ground is not spent negotiating over the audit scope, updating the auditors systems, searching for missing hardware, or refreshing oneself with the SAFETAG framework. To that end negotiations with the host organization help reveal if the organization has the capacity to undertake the audit and respond to its findings.

### Guiding Questions

* Does the organization have existing digital security practices or has it attempted to implement them in the past?
* What agreements will govern the audit?
* What will be the procedure for incident handling in the event that the auditor causes or uncovers an incident during the course of the assessment?
* What are the legal, physical, or social risks for the auditor & organization associated with conducting the audit or having audit results leak? [^PETS_legal_considerations]
* Does the security situation of the location or organization require additional planning? Are your software tools up to date and working as expected?
