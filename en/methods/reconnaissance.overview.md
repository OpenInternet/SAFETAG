## Reconnaissance

### Summary

The remote assessment methodology focuses on direct observation of an organization and their infrastructure, consisting of passive reconnaissance of publicly available data sources ("Open Source Intelligence") This allows the auditor to identify publicly available resources (such as websites, extranets, email servers, but also social media information) connected to the organization and remotely gather information about those resources.

### Purpose


While much of SAFETAG focuses on digital security challenges within and around the office,  unintended information available from "open sources" can pose real threats and deserve significant attention.  This also builds the Auditor's understanding of the organization's digital presence  and will guide specific vulnerabilities to investigate once on site.

### The Flow Of Information

### Guiding Questions


* Depending on the organization's security needs, does it "leak" any sensitive information online (location, staff identities, program locations?)
* Can you identify partners or beneficiaries through the organizations sites?
* What is the pattern for staff e-mail addresses?
* Have any of the the organization's servers, users, or e-mail accounts been compromised in the past?
* Are executive / staff social media accounts in scope, and if so, are they compliant with the organizational social media policies? What additional threats do they introduce?
