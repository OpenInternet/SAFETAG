## User Device Assessment

### Summary

This component allows the auditor to assess the security of the individual devices on the network. This component consists of interviews, surveys, and inspection of devices.

### Purpose


Compromised devices have the ability to undermine nearly any other organizational attempt at securing information. Knowing if devices receive basic software and security upgrades and what core protections against unauthorized access exist is vital to designing a strategy to make the host more secure.
